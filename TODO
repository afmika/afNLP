make the file loader async
some datas looks like "word1_word2..."

Tokenize
- replace [\s]+ by a single space [\s]
- consider stuff in << "" >> as a single token
- for each token split by "," or ";" => makes more subtoken
- for each token split by space
- compare each token with the database and categorize it

foreach tokens replace _ by a space
once it's done and If the tokens is in the
sentence (regex test + lenvenshtein) then push
it into an array
