make the file loader async
some datas looks like "word1_word2..."

Tokenize
- replace [\s]+ by a single space [\s]
- consider stuff in << "" >> as a single token
- for each token split by "," or ";" => makes more subtoken
- for each token split by space

Classification
for each token in db compare it with
the regex of the current word token
if it fails use levenshtein distance
=> labelize the word with a temporary class
